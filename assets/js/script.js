            <h2>Church History</h2>
            <p>
              The San Juan Nepomuceno Church, standing on Padre Burgos Street,
              traces its origins to San Juan de Bolboc, which separated from
              Rosario, Batangas, in 1874 due to flooding in its original location.
              The present church, inaugurated on January 24, 1894, has undergone
              renovations, with support from affluent families and parishioners,
              and was dedicated in 1996 by the National Historical Commission.
            </p>
            <p>
              A legend tells of St. John Nepomucene's image being found in a
              bubbling spring, which stopped bubbling when the icon was retrieved,
              while wartime stories recall divine interventions, including an
              attempt by Japanese soldiers to burn the church, which miraculously
              failed. Captain Takano, a Japanese officer, reportedly saw the
              saint walking through their camp and later became a regular
              churchgoer, convinced of the saint's presence.

            <h2>Casa Louella </h2>
            <p>
            Closer to the church stands another captivating American-era mansion called Casa Louella, named after the daughter of its current owners, Custodio Marasigan Ona and Guadalupe Ona. The mansion was originally built by the Treviño-Magtibay family in the early 1900s. The second owner was Vicente Lecaroz, a former mayor of San Juan, and a nephew of Benito Marasigan, owner of the Benito Marasigan Mansion. His family occupied the house during his term as mayor. When his children grew up, the house was often empty, and decided to sell it in 1994.

            The Mercado House, built in 1936 during American colonization, was owned by Aguedo Mercado and his wife, Pilar, and became a favored place for Japanese officials during World War II; it featured a mix of Neo-classical and Art Nouveau styles, with floral decorations, Corinthian and Ionic columns, curving grillwork, and 98% French furniture. Elevated for air circulation and storage, the house had hardwood interiors, Machuka tiles, a white plastered cement exterior, and a "Tejas" roof, which was renovated in 1998.
