              <h2>Church History</h2>
              <p>
                The San Juan Nepomuceno Church, standing on Padre Burgos Street,
                traces its origins to San Juan de Bolboc, which separated from
                Rosario, Batangas, in 1874 due to flooding in its original location.
                The present church, inaugurated on January 24, 1894, has undergone
                renovations, with support from affluent families and parishioners,
                and was dedicated in 1996 by the National Historical Commission.

                A legend tells of St. John Nepomucene's image being found in a
                bubbling spring, which stopped bubbling when the icon was retrieved,
                while wartime stories recall divine interventions, including an
                attempt by Japanese soldiers to burn the church, which miraculously
                failed. Captain Takano, a Japanese officer, reportedly saw the
                saint walking through their camp and later became a regular
                churchgoer, convinced of the saint's presence.
